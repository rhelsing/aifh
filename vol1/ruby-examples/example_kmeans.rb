# This example shows how to use KMeans clustering on iris data set.  There is not enough information in the
# iris data set to perfectly cluster the  flowers.  However, you will notice that species will
# mostly cluster together.

#same as normalize

#delete category column

# Cluster the Iris data set.
# res, idx = kmeans2(np.array(iris_data), k)
#
# Print results normalized
# for cluster_num in range(0, k):
#   print( "Cluster #" + str(cluster_num + 1))
#   for i in range(0, len(idx)):
#     if idx[i] == cluster_num:
#       print( str(iris_data[i]) + "," + classes[i])
#     end
#   end
